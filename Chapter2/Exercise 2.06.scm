; Exercise 2.6: In case representing pairs as procedures wasn’t mind-boggling enough, consider that, in a language that can manipulate procedures, we can get by without numbers (at least insofar as nonnegative integers are concerned) by implementing 0 and the operation of adding 1 as

; (define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))

; (define (add-1 n)
;   (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x)))))
; This representation is known as Church numerals, after its inventor, Alonzo Church, the logician who invented the λ-calculus.

; Define one and two directly (not in terms of zero and add-1). (Hint: Use substitution to evaluate (add-1 zero)). Give a direct definition of the addition procedure + (not in terms of repeated application of add-1).
