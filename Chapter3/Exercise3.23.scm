Exercise 3.23: A deque (“double-ended queue”) is a sequence in which items can be inserted and deleted at either the front or the rear. Operations on deques are the constructor make-deque, the predicate empty-deque?, selectors front-deque and rear-deque, and mutators front-insert-deque!, rear-insert-deque!, front-delete-deque!, rear-delete-deque!. Show how to represent deques using pairs, and give implementations of the operations.151 All operations should be accomplished in Θ(1)Θ(1) steps.
