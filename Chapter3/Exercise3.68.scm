; Exercise 3.68: Louis Reasoner thinks that building a stream of pairs from three parts is unnecessarily complicated. Instead of separating the pair (S0,T0)(S0,T0) from the rest of the pairs in the first row, he proposes to work with the whole first row, as follows:

; (define (pairs s t)
;   (interleave
;    (stream-map
;     (lambda (x) 
;       (list (stream-car s) x))
;     t)
;    (pairs (stream-cdr s)
;           (stream-cdr t))))
; Does this work? Consider what happens if we evaluate (pairs integers integers) using Louis’s definition of pairs.

; infinite evaluate the interleave and pairs
