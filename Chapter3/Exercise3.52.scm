; Exercise 3.52: Consider the sequence of expressions

; (define sum 0)

; (define (accum x)
;   (set! sum (+ x sum))
;   sum)

; (define seq 
;   (stream-map 
;    accum 
;    (stream-enumerate-interval 1 20)))

; (define y (stream-filter even? seq))

; (define z 
;   (stream-filter 
;    (lambda (x) 
;      (= (remainder x 5) 0)) seq))

; (stream-ref y 7)
; (display-stream z)
; What is the value of sum after each of the above expressions is evaluated? What is the printed response to evaluating the stream-ref and display-stream expressions? Would these responses differ if we had implemented (delay ⟨exp⟩) simply as (lambda () ⟨exp⟩) without using the optimization provided by memo-proc? Explain.
