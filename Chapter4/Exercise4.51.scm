; Exercise 4.51: Implement a new kind of assignment called permanent-set! that is not undone upon failure. For example, we can choose two distinct elements from a list and count the number of trials required to make a successful choice as follows:

; (define count 0)
; (let ((x (an-element-of '(a b c)))
;       (y (an-element-of '(a b c))))
;   (permanent-set! count (+ count 1))
;   (require (not (eq? x y)))
;   (list x y count))

; ;;; Starting a new problem
; ;;; Amb-Eval value:
; (a b 2)

; ;;; Amb-Eval input:
; try-again

; ;;; Amb-Eval value:
; (a c 3)
; What values would have been displayed if we had used set! here rather than permanent-set!?
